## Screen Saver
Screen saver that you would typically see if you left your computer for too long. It spawns and generates plus sign looking shapes and resets after a little bit.

## Bouncing Ball Simulator
This is a simulator I made for my final in Honors Physics in my freshman year of highschool. It is supposed to show collisions with velocity between balls in a 2D plane.

## Bonle
Bonle is a guessing game where you guess bones in the human skeletal system and if the bone you guessed isnt the target bone, it will turn a certain shade of red. Darker/More red means that its **closer** to the target bone, and Lighter/Less red means that it is **farther** from the target bone.
